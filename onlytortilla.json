It wasn’t easy stumbling through life to get to this moment, life isn’t easy. When the guardian died, I just felt so lost. I felt so lost without their music, so I came over here and just said what’s on my mind, like I’m talking to them. And to see everyone hear me and listen to my stories, it comforts me in a way, and motivates me to write more, and just keep on going. And so I’m here. One year older and coated with charm\nAnyway, the point is I am here right now in this moment, still alive and somewhat well. And it’s you guys that helped me going. When points reaches so low I couldn’t even breathe for myself, I knew I had so many people who share my experiences and/or want to help me. So I want to say thank you. Thank you all for all the opportunities, life, perseverance, and kindness. All of the pain, grief, sacrifice and guilt goes away when I read every comment. And I hope you all feel the same",

I feel a bit ill and might want to throw up, but I think it’s just from the musty bus ride near home",

I then practiced my volleyball which helped me feel energised. I focused on aim today. I practiced my Serbian today and it was really fun. I got to learn some old songs and express myself more. My father helped me with this. I’m looking forward to learning some more",

I feel like I really matured during these months, and my desire to succeed is stronger than ever. Thank you to everyone who stuck by my side during these 600 days, it means a lot!!!! I feel a lot better when I make these entries, and it really does help me!!!! I focused on revision today, since I have science exams in a couple of weeks. Then I binged Netflix and now I’m here. Thank you everyone, have a good night",

I went to go see top gun in 4DX with my father, brother and uncle as a way to spend time together before my uncle leaves. It was surreal, I really liked it, however I haven’t seen the old top gun, but I do plan on watching it soon. The seats were crazy. We then came back home and enjoyed some coffee and talked about certain things",
