            <p>Please take a couple of moments to review our terms & conditions.</p>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Destiny Software Productions' policy to respect your privacy
                regarding
                any information we may collect from you across our website, http://www.plaympe.com ,

            <p>When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web
                browser.
                This data is considered “non-identifying information”, as it does not personally identify you on its
                own. It
                may include your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you
                visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details.</p>
            <p>This data is considered “identifying information”, as it can personally identify you. We only request
                personal information relevant to providing you with a service, and only use it to help provide or
                improve
                this service.</p>
            <p>We collect information by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know
                why
                we’re collecting it and how it will be used. You are free to refuse our request for this information,
                with
                the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services without it.
            </p>
            <p>We may use a combination of identifying and non-identifying information to understand who our visitors
                are,
                how they use our services, and how we may improve their experience of our website in future. We do not
                disclose the specifics of this information publicly, but may share aggregated and anonymised versions of
                this information, for example, in website and customer usage trend reports.</p>
            <p>We may use your personal details to contact you with updates about our website and services, along with
                promotional content that we believe may be of interest to you. If you wish to opt out of receiving

                protection laws that reflect our commitment to protecting the privacy of our users.</p>
            <p>We only retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide a service, or to improve our
                services
                in future. While we retain this data, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent
